## Use Case

Influenced by the beautiful sunsets and beginning of summer, Potsie decided to cook BBQ tonight. She doesn’t own many items to make a BBQ but wants a gas grill. She figures the best place to go is Target because they have everything. While in-store she uses the app to look what other users’ BBQ looks like. She then decides to use the app to design what her perfect BBQ. Happy with the result, she shares what she created with her friends. Brenda, her best friend, see her post on Pinterest. Brenda really likes the grill Potsie selected and buys it from Target online.
