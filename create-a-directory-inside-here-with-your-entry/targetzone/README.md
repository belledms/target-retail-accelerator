# The Sonic Team presents TargetZONE
## The app for finding deals, coupons, reviews, and content on items as you walk around the store. 
###The app works by using Sonic Notify technology to localize a phone in front of a item on a store shelf. Example: Once the app knows you are in front of the potato chips, then the app responds and shows you the content. 

## What is Sonic Notify?
[Sonic Notify](http://www.sonicnotify.com) is a company that provides a mobile SDK and platform for delivering content through inaudible sound. The TargetZone app uses Sonic Notify beacons arranged through a store to deliver content to the consumer durring their shopping trip.
