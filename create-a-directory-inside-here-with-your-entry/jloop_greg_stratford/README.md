The LESS app is a social shopping experience designed to enable Target
shoppers to share ideas and inspire each other - before, during and
after shopping. Through photography, the mobile application becomes a
community of creative Target shoppers and those looking for a spark of
inspiration. The app serves as a social style consultant and platform
for sharing inspired purchases in a seamless and immersive experience.  

LESS performs its magic in two modes:

1.  **Create Mode** - *Create and share imaginative uses of Target products
    as part of the shopping experience at home or in-store.*  Users
    assemble unique “creations” - a fashion ensemble in the store, an
    arrangement of furnishings at home, preparations for a party - and
    share their creations using the camera on their smartphone.  To
    complete a creation, users tag Target products by tapping and
    scanning product barcodes or searching the Target catalog.  To
    publish, users write a brief description of their creation and then
    post it for The League.  The most inspiring creators are rewarded
    with Target discounts as they achieve specified levels of
    endorsements through “likes” or “followers”.
2.  **Explore Mode** - *Explore and discover the creations of others and be
    inspired by fresh ideas curated by an active social community.*
    Shoppers discover inspirational creations made by others - easily
    exploring using a variety of filters such as *popular* and *featured*,
    creations they *liked*, creators they *follow*, *categories*, and
    creations described with particular *keywords* or *tags*.  Shoppers can
    receive instant inspiration by simply scanning a product’s barcode
    and magically window-shop creations that feature that product.  The
    best ideas are lifted to the top by the LESS community and once a
    shopper finds a creation they want, they can push the related
    products to their TargetLists®, accessible online or via the Target
    retail app.  
  
###User Story \#1: Jennifer, creative shopper

Jennifer lives creatively, and on a budget.  She loves to express
herself by combining fashion items to create a new and unique look - and
she loves the values she finds at Target.  She lives her life with
creativity by bringing together simple home products to design a new
setting, or by assembling decor and food items to create a perfectly
themed party.  Jennifer has a knack for using everyday products in fresh
and lively ways.

With LESS, Jennifer now has a tool to help her record her own creative
ideas as she shops at Target or after she gets home.  With the tap of
her finger in “Create Mode” she can snap a quick photo of a fashion
ensemble or a newly decorated room.  She simply tags the items in the
photo to link the Target products.  Its a quick and simple way for her
to create her own personal scrapbook of fashion, style, and lifestyle.  

On top of that, Jennifer loves to share her creations.  Through LESS,
she can share creative ideas with others and inspire them to discover
products they can wear and use in ways they might not have envisioned.
 She can share her ideas with anyone in the League of Extraordinary
Social Shoppers.  

Best of all, since she makes such awesome creations, she is rewarded
with Target discounts when she reaches Creator Achievements - as other
participants in The League follow her, *like* her creations, or
*purchase* products discovered through her creations.  No wonder Jennifer
loves to shop at Target so much!

###User Story \#2: David, uninspired shopper

-----------------------------------------

David is a Target quick shopper.  Get in.  Get out.  The last thing
David wants to do is spend hours in the store looking for new clothes or
coordinating the decoration of his apartment.  He wants to be stylish -
he just needs a little inspiration - fast.

Luckily, David can do more with LESS (wink-wink).  David has a wealth of
ideas at his fingertips from other Target shoppers - in categories like
Men’s Clothing, Gift Ideas, Party Ideas, Home Decor, and more.  No more
wasting time trying to figure out if the lamp in this aisle will match
the rug in that aisle.  Using “Explore Mode” he can get ideas for
fashion combinations that work - from a trusted community.  He can even
scan the tag of a particular product he likes to find other items that
go with it.  David can see what other people - real people like him -
look like in various outfits, or how that lamp/rug combo will look in a
real apartment like his.

Once David finds something that inspires him, with a simple tap he can
push the related products to his TargetLists®, so he’s ready when he
gets to the store. David may even find that he is inspired by a
particular Creator and *follow* that person for future ideas on fashion,
decorating, or other lifestyle product lines.  Using in-store location
services, when David opens the app in the home furnishings section, he
is immediately inspired by ideas relevant to where he is standing.

David is feeling pretty cool.  He’s finding products that keep him in
style while saving him major hassle.  With all this mojo in his pocket,
David is actually getting more and spending LESS!
