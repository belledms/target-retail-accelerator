Description

We are working on a product to enable target shoppers share the cool things to buy on their social networks (Facebook/Twitter/Foursquare) and allow other target shoppers and friends to discover the cool things to buy at target.

This is a new concept and as of April 30, 2013 we have not released any code beta related to this project.

Please see the attached document for more details. (TraceExecutiveSummaryTarget.pdf)
