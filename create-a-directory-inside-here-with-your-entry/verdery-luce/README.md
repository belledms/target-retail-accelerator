# Target Together submission by Verdery-Luce

* Get togethers, parties, and celebrations bring people and smiles together. We came up with a concept to leverage Targetâ€™s API in a new, disruptive and social way. Frequently when going to a party people are asked to contribute certain items be it chips, chairs, beverages, etc. We want to make a visual map of people who are going to a party and what they are bringing. This will eliminate confusion and prevent 10 bags of chips forming an unclimbable mountain on the side table. It will also engage both the person setting up the event and the people attending by allowing them to interact and check off what they are bringing in a fun visual manner. More in the attached PDF.
