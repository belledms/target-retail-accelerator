## Overview
Style Board is a mobile shopping and social media experience that allows users to design their own fashion looks and share them with friends or place the entire ensembles into their shopping cart with one easy tap. The app conveniently stores the users size and preferences so unavailable and irrelevant items are not shown. Once an item has been purchased this information is stored in the users Wardrobe and can be used to mix with other new looks in the future.
