##Description

**TL;DR** (aka _Executive Summary_): **Crosshair is an intelligent and customizable mobile search filter for the Target catalog.** Crosshair is similar to the "Magic 8-Balls" toys of many folk's childhoods (and even adulthoods): you ask a question, shake the 8-Ball, turn it over an get your answer. Simple. Easy. Amusing. Instead of using a plastic toy, Crosshair uses the Target API, a clever UI, search filtering, and the motion sensing capabilities of smartphones, to deliver relevant and surprising results.

###Example Use Case

It's your girlfriend's birthday. You want to surprise her with a gift. You know that she loves glass vases but you don't know much about them, except for the blue one she purchased with you 6 months ago at an antiques show. You know that if you ask her, or her big-mouth friends, the secret will be spoiled. While in the shopping mall, as you walk past your local Target, you remember that you have the Crosshair app installed on your smartphone. You fire it up, and tap "blue glass vases" into the search box on the welcome screen. A few moments later, the initial match crosshair comes up, centered on blue glass vases. The initial match looks similar to the one she purchased with you, too close. You give the phone a quick shake, and a moment later the crosshair is centered on a pretty interesting-looking vase, one that's related to the initial match, but that you're sure your GF doesn't currently possess. You would never have picked this one out it in a million years. You click on the bullseye to get the product details: it turns out that the price is right, and the vase is in stock! You purchase it in the store and have it gift wrapped, and a day later, surprise the GF, who's amazed at your great taste. Mobile search and navigation through Target's large product catalog has just been made fast, fun, and easy.

###Quick Overview

As stated above: Crosshair is an intelligent and customizable mobile search filter for the Target catalog that will reveal the best products and closest neighbors (similar products, along any number of spectra, which can be pre-selected by Target, or customized by the customer.)

...don't like what you found? Click on one of the neighbors mapped on the crosshair UI, and the interface reorients and recenters on your selection.

...or just shake your device to get a surprise view of products neighboring your original search.

...click on the bullseye to get detailed product information, check in-store availability, add products to your shopping cart, or save to a Target shopping list.

...in addition to the native search capability, searches can also be triggered by selecting items from a saved Target shopping list, or by scanning barcodes, if the host smartphone has that capability.

...built-in social features lets you save your crosshairs and share them with family, friends, coworkers, and which can be reused as the starting points for further discovery.

###Additional Details

The customer can view the product details by clicking on the bullseye, where detailed information from the Target product catalog can be obtained, such as pricing, product reviews, stocking/availability, and the product can be ordered (placed into a shopping cart), or added to a Target list for later retrieval.

If the customer is more interested in _discovering_ related products that may be more popular or _more surprising/cooler/different_ than the initial match, she can return to the crosshair interface, and click on one of the "neighbor" products mapped. The UI will reorient and center itself on the selection, and reveal new neighbors, while keeping the original closest match in sight.

If the customer wants to have that "Magic 8 Ball" experience, she'll just give her touch-sensitive mobile device a quick shake, and the crosshair will randomize the neighbors, reorient and recenter automatically, once again keeping the original closest match in sight.

This mobile app and UI showcases products, and similar items, in a novel, compact way, that also makes the experience engaging for the customer—a hallmark of the Target brand experience. Crosshair uses the dominant visual conceit of Target's corporate identity—the target—as a feature. Moveover, the interface—if executed as imagined here, and which is based on the classic quadrant matrix—presents some unique ways to present products across different dimensions which can be customized by Target, or even the customers themselves.

Built-in "list" functionality will allow customers to replay, save, and share Crosshair results as list with other family members, friends, bridal registry invitees, baby shower members, etc.
