Target Mobile Challenge
The Situation
Target has always had the market cornered on delivering both wants and needs.

WANT: Guests want key merchandise—electronics, toys during holiday
NEED: Guests are motivated by price; Target guests are particularly driven by needing to feel savvy and securing the lowest available price

“Half of all people who purchase products online first go to a brick-and-mortar store to do their research, according to a recent ClickIQ survey of 900 shoppers. Known as “showrooming,” this habit is taking an increasingly large bite out of retailers’ bottom lines. 

That’s because in many cases, consumers buy the product for less from an online-only e-tailer such as Amazon rather than from the actual store or the website of the merchant where they just shopped. “*

Guests continue to use bricks and mortar stores as showrooms for in-demand merchandise, only to abandon that key shopping experience, go home and shop by price.

WHAT GUESTS WANT: to shop at Target
Guests want a showroom that delivers it all in a single experience: they want Target’s friendly, bright, wide-aisle and happy shopping experience, plus the assurance that they’re getting the best price, and above all, they want to purchase and take their merchandise home right now. The thrill of shopping, price confidence and immediate purchase is the all-at-once shopping solution retailers have not yet been able to deliver. 

WHAT GUESTS NEED: the solution

YOUR TARGET SHOWROOM
1.	Shop at the Target store they love
2.	Confirm the lowest price by price matching on the spot using their mobile device
3.	Purchase immediately and take the merch home—or, when convenient, confirm in-home delivery
